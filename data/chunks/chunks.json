  " 4 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC \n \nWe had a solid finish to 2025. Q4 revenue grew 18.2% year-over-year in constant currency, and full year 2025 \nrevenue grew 18.2% in constant currency to $3.1 billion. We delivered another quarter of standout operating profit \ngrowth, with operating margin of 22.6% in Q4 and 18.6% for the full year. We now serve more than 288,000 \ncustomers globally. We added 9,800 net new customers in Q4 and more than 40,000 customers for the year. That \ngrowth at our scale says something important. Customers trust HubSpot during a time of transformative change in \nthe industry driven by AI. \n \nI'm also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors have authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 \nbillion. A clear signal of the confidence we have in our business and the growth opportunity ahead. Two themes \ndrove our performance in 2025: strong Core Seat fundamentals and momentum with our agentic customer \nplatform. \n \nFirst, our core fundamentals are solid. Upmarket momentum was consistent all year with a strong finish in \nDecember. Large companies are consolidating on HubSpot, because we deliver the power they want with the \nease of use they need. In 2025, deals over $5,000 in monthly recurring revenue grew 33% and deals over \n$10,000 grew 41%. The number of customers with 500 or more seats grew fivefold, making it one of the strongest \nupmarket years. This is the direct result of years of focused product investment, the moat we have built with our \npartner ecosystem, and our growing brand credibility with larger companies. \n \nRentokil Initial, a global leader in pest control, used Marketing Hub to increase leads by 76% and deliver a 671% \nROI. That success led them to expand HubSpot. Now, they use HubSpot Enterprise product suite across more \nthan 100 teams to scale their go-to-market strategy.

Mercantile Bank, a financial institution with over 700 \nemployees, consolidated six separate solutions onto Marketing Hub and saw an immediate improvement in \nefficiency and personalization capabilities. This success prompted them to expand to Sales Hub, Service Hub, \nand Content Hub, and replace their legacy CRM, giving them a unified view of customer, while lowering costs. \n \nMulti-hub adoption accelerated again this year. In 2025, 62% of new Pro+ customers landed with multiple hubs. \nWe saw two common patterns with new customers. They landed with Marketing and Sales Hub or with Marketing, \nSales, Service, Content and Operations, five hubs operating as one go-to-market platform. Multi-hub expansion is \nalso showing up across our install base, with 40% of Pro+ install base by ARR owning four or more hubs, up 6 \npoints year-over-year. We are the agentic customer platform of choice for scaling companies, and multi-hub \nadoption is the new norm. \n \nOur pricing changes also created meaningful tailwind in 2025. As a reminder, we lowered the price point to get \nstarted, removed seat minimums to make upgrades easy, and added Core Seats that deliver platform value. That \nshift is largely complete. Approximately 90% of our legacy customers have moved into the new pricing model and \nalmost 50% of our ARR has gone through their first renewal. \n \nThe impact is showing up clearly in the data. We continue to see strength in net customer additions aided by the \nchanges. And despite the questions we get on seat compression, we saw customers buy more Sales Hub seats, \nService Hub seats and Core Seats throughout the year. All of this reinforces our confidence that our core \nfundamentals are strong and built to drive durable growth. \n \nStrong fundamentals matter, but what defined 2025 was our momentum in AI. We are clear about who we serve, \ngrowing companies with 2 to 2,000 employees. That's where we win and that's who we build for.

AI native, like Lovable, Browserbase, and squint.ai, are choosing HubSpot as their \nplatform to drive growth. \n \nNow, let's talk about AI adoption. Our agents gained real traction last year. Customer Agent handles support \ntickets and answers questions across the full customer journey. More than 8,000 customers activated it last year \nand are seeing mid-60s resolution rates, driven by product innovation. Prospecting Agent helps sales teams \nresearch accounts, personalize outreach, and engage prospects. Over 10,000 customers have activated it, up \n57% quarter-over-quarter. This is a clear use case with strong pull. Customers using it are booking nearly twice \nas many meetings compared to last year. \n \nAt Inbound, we launched Data Agent, which automatically enriches customer data. More than 2,500 customers \nhave already activated it, a clear signal that customers want AI to take on the manual work that slows teams \ndown. And while it's still early, our usage-based credits model is starting to scale. In Q4, Customer Agent \naccounted for about 60% of credits consumed. Data Agent, Prospecting Agent, and intent monitoring, each \ncontribute between 10% to 15% of credits consumed. All of this reinforces the clear point. AI is becoming a core \ndriver of how our customers grow, and therefore, how we grow. \n \nOkay, let's look ahead to 2026.

AI is becoming a core \ndriver of how our customers grow, and therefore, how we grow. \n \nOkay, let's look ahead to 2026. Our strategy is clear and focused on three things: making AI work for growth \ncompanies, reimagining marketing with a new playbook and products, and accelerating upmarket growth with a \nplatform that delivers both power and simplicity. \n \nFirst, we're focused on making AI work for growth companies. While there's no shortage of AI solutions in the \nmarket, there is a real gap between generating AI output and driving growth outcomes. Closing that gap is what \nwill unlock broad AI adoption, and that requires context, having the right information at the right time with the \njudgment to know what to do with it. And that's where HubSpot has a clear advantage. \n \nMost AI tools ask customers to bring their own context, upload brand guidelines, teach the system who their \ncustomer is, and how their business works, then do it again for the next agent or LLM, and again, that's \nbackwards. With HubSpot, context is shared and powers everything. Our AI vision is to lead with our agentic \ncustomer platform, where unified customer data, business context, pure benchmarks across more than 288,000 \ncustomers, and deep domain expertise powers workflows and agents. \n \nTo do this, we are bringing together three interconnected layers: context layer, where customer understanding \nlives; action layer with our hubs and agents, where they help do work; and a coordination layer to connect \neverything. You will see us accelerate this vision throughout this year. It will show up in powerful use cases where \nAI does real work for teams and drives measurable growth. That is our AI strategy. \n \nAt the same time, marketing is going through the biggest shift we have seen in decades. Search traffic is declining \nas AI-generated answers become the starting point for product and brand discovery. Customers are spending \ntime across more channels, and AI is creating new ways for companies to be found. We saw these changes \ncoming and have deliberately diversified our marketing channels. \n \nLast year, YouTube leads grew 68%, newsletter leads grew 53%, and HubSpot became the most visible CRM in",

And now, we're turning what we have learned into a playbook and product for our \ncustomers. We launched the Loop, a new growth playbook for the AI era, along with AI-powered solutions to help \nteams put it into action. Data Hub gives customers clean, unified data foundations, essential for marketing in the \nAI era. And Marketing Studio provides an AI-powered workspace to plan and create campaigns faster.

Customers are already \nseeing results. \n \nDocebo, an AI-powered learning platform with over 1,000 employees, shifted towards AEO as organic traffic \ndeclined. Using HubSpot, they improved their visibility in LLMs and saw 13% of their leads come from new AI-\ndriven sources. And Crunch Fitness, a global brand with over 1,200 employees and 500 franchise locations, used \nHubSpot to deliver personalized on-brand messages at scale, sending more than 15 million targeted emails a \nmonth and generating 2 million leads in a year. HubSpot helped define the inbound marketing era, and we are \nuniquely positioned to lead what comes next. \n \nThe third pillar of our strategy is to keep winning upmarket. Last year was one of our strongest upmarket years. \nThat was driven by product innovation that delivered real results for larger customers. Within their first year on \nHubSpot, upmarket customers generated more leads, closed more deals, and improved ticket close rates. In \n2026, we're doubling down on that momentum.

Within their first year on \nHubSpot, upmarket customers generated more leads, closed more deals, and improved ticket close rates. In \n2026, we're doubling down on that momentum. We are aligning dedicated product resources to the needs of the \nsegment and increasing sales capacity to drive growth. This is a large market where we have clear product \nmarket fit, a strong and energized partner ecosystem, and significant room to grow. \n \nOur strategy shows up clearly in our growth levers. Our core drivers remain strong and durable: upmarket \nmomentum, multi-hub adoption, and pricing tailwinds. These are working consistently, and we expect them to \ncontinue to scale. As we enter a more transformational phase with AI, we see two emerging growth levers, Core \nSeat adoption and credits. We have significantly expanded the value of the Core Seat by including Breeze \nAssistant, enriched company data with buying intent signals, and platform features that bring teams together. \n \nAs a result, adoption of enriched data jumped from 51% to nearly 70% in Q4, a clear signal of the value \ncustomers are seeing with Core Seat. Our goal is to make the Core Seat the foundation for every go-to-market \nemployee and to drive broad adoption across teams. And as customers rely on agents to do more work on their \nbehalf, we will scale credits consumption. Together, these levers expand how customers get value from HubSpot \nand how we accelerate growth. \n \nWith that, I'll hand it over to our CFO, Kate Bueker, to walk you through our financial and operating results. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nKathryn Bueker \nChief Financial Officer, HubSpot, Inc. \nThanks, Yamini.

As a reminder, we tend to see a \nseasonal downtick in net revenue retention in Q1, followed by expansion as we move through the year. \n \nQ4 calculated billings were $971 million, growing 20% year-over-year in constant currency and 27% on an as \nreported basis. Q4 billings benefited from strong upmarket performance, resulting in a modest increase in overall \nbillings duration in the quarter. For the full year of 2025, calculated billings were $3.4 billion, growing 19% year-\nover-year in constant currency and 23% on an as reported basis. \n \nThe remainder of my comments will refer to non-GAAP measures. Q4 operating margin was 23%, up 4 points \ncompared to the year ago period and 3 points sequentially. Full year 2025 operating margin was 18.6%, up 1 \npoint year-over-year. We delivered operating leverage as a result of disciplined hiring as well as the ongoing \nbenefits of our partner commissions changes. \n \nNet income was $163 million or $3.09 in Q4 and $516 million or $9.70 per fully diluted share for the full year of \n2025.

In 2025, net new ARR growth exceeded constant currency revenue growth \nin every quarter with full year net new ARR growing 24% year-over-year, 6 points above constant currency \nrevenue growth. \n \nLooking ahead, we expect full year 2026 net new ARR growth to outpace constant currency revenue growth, \nsupported by the underlying trends Yamini outlined: continued upmarket momentum, multi-hub adoption and \npricing benefits, and the emerging impact of Core Seat adoption and credits. Going forward, we plan to share net \nnew ARR growth on an annual basis as part of our Q4 earnings. \n \nWith that, let's dive into our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2026. For the first quarter, total as \nreported revenue is expected to be in the range of $862 million to $863 million, up 16% year-over-year in constant \ncurrency and 21% on an as reported basis. Non-GAAP operating profit is expected to be between $144 million \nand $145 million, representing a 17% operating profit margin. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is \nexpected to be between $2.46 and $2.48. This assumes 52.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding. \n \nAnd for the full year of 2026, total as reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $3.69 billion to $3.7 \nbillion, up 16% year-over-year in constant currency and 18% on an as reported basis, modestly above our \nguidance for Q1 constant currency revenue growth.

Our EPS guidance for Q1 and full year 2026 includes the expected impact from our share repurchase \nprogram. And we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be 5% to 6% for the full year of 2026 and free \ncash flow to be about $740 million. \n \nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Yamini for her closing remarks. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nYamini Rangan \nChief Executive Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc. \nOkay.

It's \nasked on every earnings call of every company, and you spoke a lot in your prepared remarks about context and \nmoats, but can you dig deeper into how defensible HubSpot's role is as a system of record and maybe what your \nfear on LLM disruption is? \n \nAnd related to that, how would you respond to investors that fear that more data will be sucked into and be \nretained in, in third-party agents and that this could threaten the role of a system of record itself? I know there's a \nlot to unpack there, but I think that's what we get asked the most every day now. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nYamini Rangan \nChief Executive Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nAll right, Samad, let's start with ripping off Band-Aid. I'll probably start with the disruption threat and specifically \nour moat to address that.

All right. First off, in terms of disruption, there's a big \ndifference between point SaaS solutions and platform, and that difference matters even more in the AI era. Look, \nin the last decade, HubSpot won as a platform because we were the source for customer data. With AI, we will \nwin because we are the source of customer context, and that matters. \n \nAs I talk to customers right now, the biggest challenge we see with AI adoption, particularly in mid-market \ncompanies, is not access to more AI tools, more LLMs, more agents. There are plenty of those. The biggest \nchallenge that I see is that there is a huge gap between AI output and AI outcomes. And when I say outcomes, I \nmean more leads, more deals, more growth. And by the way, that's all our customers want to talk to us about. \nMid-market companies don't care about AI for the sake of AI. They don't want to just adopt it. They care about \ndriving growth. And if AI can help with that, they will adopt it. \n \nAnd in order for AI and agents to drive outcomes, you need customer context. This is the context that was in the \nheads of people, but now you need the patterns of what works, what doesn't work in your business, in your \nindustry, in your particular function, and then you need to be able to take an action on it. And that is what a \nplatform like HubSpot delivers. I'll give you a practical example. You can ask an LLM to generate outreach for 100 \nprospects. And then do the same thing in a platform with a history of interaction, with the prioritization of what \nsales cares about, with how your best reps handle competitive objections within your industry, and then ask it to \ngenerate outreach. \n \nThe difference is one will be AI output and the other will be AI outcomes. One produces words, the other wins \nde",

And then do the same thing in a platform with a history of interaction, with the prioritization of what \nsales cares about, with how your best reps handle competitive objections within your industry, and then ask it to \ngenerate outreach. \n \nThe difference is one will be AI output and the other will be AI outcomes. One produces words, the other wins \ndeals. One knows a lot about the external world. The platform knows specifically about the customer's world and \nwhat is happening today. There's this whole idea that AI is like a magic wand and you can abstract away all of this \nproblem and expect agents to work, it just will not. Context has to come from somewhere. It has to be trusted. It \nneeds to be real-time and it needs to be actionable. And that is what a platform like HubSpot delivers. \n \nOur strategy, as I just articulated, is to be that intelligent system of customer context. And we have the data, but \nmore importantly, we have the business context, the industry context and the domain context to deliver it. And \nthat's why customers come to us. They rely on us for that context. They want to use more of our APIs and \npartners want to customize and build on top of it. And as AI adoption accelerates, the value of our agentic \nplatform increases. \n \nOkay. Now, going to your second part of the question, which is can all the data just be completely sucked out so \nthat there is no value capture by SaaS? Well, first of all, that assumes that we will not build agents rapidly \nourselves. We are building agents on top of that customer context, and it is working and we're seeing that \nadoption. Second, it assumes that SaaS platforms are data. SaaS platforms are more than data. It is the logic, \nright? You can certainly get a nondeterministic output for a sales email, but try taking a nondeterministic output for \nyour sales forecast. That is not possible. It's workflows, like forecasting, routing, approvals, permissions, that is \nlogic, it's not data to be sucked away. And ownership, accountability and governance, all of those lives inside \napplications, and it's much easier to bring AI into these applications rather than try to extract all",

That mid-market \nsegment is what we care about. They're focused on growing business. They're not managing model complexity. \nThey're not looking at the latest LLM version. They're not stitching together AI infrastructure. They want AI that \njust works and drives measurable growth. And that's our focus: making AI simple, practical, and actionable, and \ndriving outcomes for scaling companies. That's our strategy and we think it's very defensible for the segment of \ncustomers that we are delivering value for. \nHubSpot, Inc.

Q \nGreat. Thanks for taking our questions, guys. The question I had was on acceleration, the guidance for 16% \nconstant currency growth this year, it's certainly not an acceleration, but all the breadcrumbs that you're giving us \non kind of net new ARR would mathematically just lead to acceleration.

A \nYeah, Jackson, thanks for the question. I'll just start by saying that we remain confident that we can reaccelerate \nand hit our 20% revenue growth goal. You're right, all of the leading indicators are pointing in the right direction. \nNet new ARR is, again, important for the indicator of growth for us, and we've delivered net new ARR growth in \nexcess of revenue growth now over the last six quarters. Our revenue guidance implies a modest acceleration \nthroughout 2026. \n \nAs I shared in my prepared remarks, net revenue retention is expected to expand by another 1 to 2 points this \nyear, and we're also expecting that 2026 net new ARR growth is also going to outpace constant currency revenue \ngrowth. And that's supported by all of those underlying trends that Yamini talked about: continued upmarket \nmomentum, continued multi-hub adoption, continued benefit from our ongoing pricing changes, and then those \nemerging growth levers of Core Seat adoption and credits. The momentum that we're seeing with net new ARR is \nwhat gives us the confidence that we will be able to deliver 20% revenue growth in the future. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n \nOperator: Thank you.

Kate, I was hoping to dig a little more \ninto the context of guidance, in particular a few things I want to flush out. You talked about pricing, and I just want \nto try to understand, A, how much pricing help was in 2025 versus 2026; and B, if you could comment a little bit \nabout any guidance, so to speak, on how much Core Seat growth may add and/or",

It's up about a 0.5 point from last year.

Yamini, I remember your [ph] Dario (00:36:20) keynote \nfrom Inbound and, Dharmesh, I know you spend a lot of time in the Claude ecosystem. Maybe talk to us about \nhow you see your leading-edge customers using a tool like Claude Cowork alongside HubSpot to get to a better \nand complementary outcome with both tools working side by side. Thank you. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nDharmesh Shah \nCo-Founder, Chief Technology Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nHi. Thanks for the question. So, Anthropic's Claude Cowork is still very early, and it's solving for consumer-\noriented use cases. So, it's still very early to kind of see our customers using it. What we do see customers using \nis our Claude Connector that connects a individual's account on Claude to HubSpot via our connector, and that's \ngetting increased usage. And what gives us a lot of kind of optimism is around what that's really doing is \nextending the customer platform that Yamini's been talking about and providing it via a new channel, which is \nthese kind of AI applications like Claude and ChatGPT. So, we're not seeing Claude Cowork yet, but we are \nseeing the kind of classic Claude Connector and the ChatGPT connector being used. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n \n",

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And maybe following on the previous question, to the extent that \nthe modality develops around third-party agents and agent networks that continuously have to access both to \nread and to action information within HubSpot, can you just give us a framework for how you're thinking about \nmonetization in that type of environment? And then, to some extent, how should we think about, to Keith's prior \nquestion, kind of the potential for consumption tailwinds on ARR growth, net new ARR growth on the credit side \nfor 2026 and maybe beyond? \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nYamini Rangan \nChief Executive Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc.

So, I'll start with the first one, then talk about the credit consumption. So in the \nfirst part, the way we think about ourselves is we are an open platform. That's how we won in the last decade. \nThat's how we will win in the next decade. And we want customers to bring in and use as much data as possible. \nSo, we're very open about that. We don't charge for customers bringing in the data. The more complete the \ncustomer context, the better outcomes that we can deliver. So we don't try to restrict that, and we try to enable \nthat. \n \nThe",
  " is we are an open platform. That's how we won in the last decade. \nThat's how we will win in the next decade. And we want customers to bring in and use as much data as possible. \nSo, we're very open about that. We don't charge for customers bringing in the data. The more complete the \ncustomer context, the better outcomes that we can deliver. So we don't try to restrict that, and we try to enable \nthat. \n \nThe second thing I would say is we also want partners building on top of HubSpot. And this could be workflows, \nthis could be agents, this could be custom apps, and we want that to happen. And we've always been partner-\nfriendly. We will continue to operate that way. The part that we will say we're very disciplined is around platform \naccess at scale. If other agents or other platforms that are emerging are relying on our customer context, that \naccess, we will monitor it, we will meter it, and we will monetize it. And specifically, if it is high-frequency \nextraction at scale, if it's like bulk exports of data or content or context, we will govern it and monetize that \naccordingly. \n \nSo, the way to think about our platform is we are open by design, but we're not a free data pipeline for everybody \nto take that information out. We're an intelligent customer platform. Access to that context is valuable, and we'll \nprice it in a way that is fair, scalable, and aligned to the value that we create for customers, which means we'll \nalso share the value. So that's in terms of our posture. The second question you asked is around monetization \nspecifically of credit and how we think about that as tailwind now and maybe in the future. \n \nAnd I'll start by saying that we're beginning to see real usage beyond included credits, and that's, again, \nhappening because customers are getting clear, measurable value. And the biggest driver today that we see is \nCustomer Agent. I talked about this. This has got clear product market fit and clear value, and customers are \nusing it to resolve support tickets, but they're also using it to answer tickets in terms of marketing as well as sales. \nAnd it represents nearly 60% of the credits that are getting consumed right now. \n \nWe are also seeing very strong adoption in three",

This has got clear product market fit and clear value, and customers are \nusing it to resolve support tickets, but they're also using it to answer tickets in terms of marketing as well as sales. \nAnd it represents nearly 60% of the credits that are getting consumed right now. \n \nWe are also seeing very strong adoption in three other use cases. Prospecting Agent has found really clear fit. \nAnd think about this agent. It can do account research, it can monitor your contacts, and then it can drive \noutreach based on the signal that you get about a company or a particular contact. And given how much \ndisruption is happening in terms of the lead, this has got real pull. I talk to customers, day in and day out, about \nProspecting Agent. \n \nNow, what is interesting is how customers are buying credits. They're not just like thinking of this as an \nexperiment. They're beginning to scale it. They're starting with what's included, then they replace real work, and \nthen they allocate more budget, and that is real positive green shoot. One of our customers, SkyTrak and \nGOLFTEC, they piloted this Customer Agent and started with 10,000 support chats a month. That agent was so \neffective that it used up all of the included credit in four hours. Then they allocated another $50,000 of their \nbudget for credit and treated it more like a work replacement. \n \nSo, where we are is we have the scaffolding in place. Agents are clearly adding value. They're being adopted. \nThe credit mechanisms are in place. We're beginning to deliver value, and we see this as a tailwind and an \nemerging lever, both in 2026 as well as many years to come. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n \nOperator: Thank you.

Yamini, with the \nagentic ecosystem build-out seemingly accelerating throughout the quarter, whether it be through Frontier, \nClaude Code, Opus, et cetera, how did deal velocity trend in the quarter relative to prior periods? Are the weekly \nannouncements of the next use case-specific agent or a new model that specializes in coding, are those types of \nannouncements causing any sort of confusion or slowdown in the pipeline? Maybe a better way of asking it is, \nhow are customers and prospects digesting to these announcements in real time? \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nYamini Rangan \nChief Executive Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nI actually really like this question. I'll tell you, there is a huge disconnect between what's happening in terms of \nannouncements and how investors are processing it and the actual conversations that we're having with \ncustomers in terms of AI adoption and use case. Again, I'll remind that the segment that we serve, there are 2 to \n2,000 employee companies. They have a business to run, and they're not chasing every announcement that is \nhappening out there. And if you look at the pipeline and what we are talking about, the first conversation that we \nhave is how can it drive innovation and growth? It is not a, how can I name the announcement of this week? It's \nreally, how can I drive adoption and growth for ourselves? And we deliver that. \n \nWe deliver our platform.

Our next question comes from the line of Taylor \nMcGinnis from UBS. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nTaylor McGinnis \nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \nYeah. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Kate, maybe just on the acceleration that we could see \nthroughout this year, you mentioned a lot of growth drivers earlier, but could you just break out how much price is \ncontributing to that versus some of the other growth drivers around seats and credit adoption? Like could we be \ngetting to the point that you mentioned earlier that credits are scaling? Could that start to add 1 point to growth \nthis year? We'd just love to hear a little bit more about the breakout of those. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nKathryn Bueker \nChief Financial Officer, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nYeah. Thanks so much for the question. I actually think, Taylor, the easiest way to talk about it is through the \ntrends that we're seeing in net revenue retention. As you know, net revenue retention was up this year, 105% in \nQ4. It was up to 103% for the full year, and that's about 1.7 points up from last year.

As you remember, one of the things that happened with the pricing model \nHubSpot, Inc.

So, people \nbought the seats that they needed and there was a much more natural upgrade path from there. \n \nThe other contributor was what you're talking about, which is as customers migrated and came up for a renewal, \nthey would see up to a 5% pricing increase. And that did help support net revenue retention in 2025. It will support \nnet revenue retention in 2026, again, to a similar amount. But the bigger driver of the expansion this year and into \nnext year were the other factors associated with the pricing change. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n \nOperator: Thank you.

A \nYeah. Thanks a lot, Kirk. Look, we have been transforming HubSpot completely through AI. I'll start with coding. \nThe way we build products has transformed completely. 97% of the code that was committed last year was done \nwith AI assist. And if you look at our top engineers, they are living and breathing in agentic coding with Claude \nCode, and that's how we build. And that has certainly changed the pace of innovation, but also the types of \ninnovation that we're able to bring to the customers. So, that's like number one. It has changed dramatically. \n \nAnd then when you think about how we serve, we have been on this path of transforming with AI. Support, \ncompletely done. Our support is the first-year support, and nearly 60% of our support is handled by AI, which \nmeans our teams are spending on much more complex cases. We've been using AI to transform marketing as \nwell as prospecting. Our prospecting approach internally has changed the level of meetings and the level of \npipeline that we bring. And in a given quarter, 10,000 to 15,000 meetings are being set up internally through \nprospecting. \n \nAnd almost everything that we do from sales in terms of note capture, in terms of deal progression, in terms of \nsmart guidance for getting deals, all of that has grown, which means, at the end of the day, our efficiency in terms \nof support, our efficiency in terms of sales, and our efficiency in terms of building pipeline has increased. And \noverall, as a company, we are leaning very hard into AI. We set ourselves a target last year to say we want every \nHubSpotter to be inspired and work in this new AI-first manner.

Wonderful. Thanks. Hi, this is Rishi Jaluria. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe I want to drill into \none thing. So, Yamini, I was struck by you mentioning Lovable as a customer during the prepared remarks. \nWithout talking specifically about a single customer, definitely see it striking that the market clearly is worried that \nvibe coding is going to replace incumbent platforms. But one of the leaders in vibe coding is using you and tells us \nthe power of that. \n \nSo, my question is really this, as you think about your own adoption amongst AI natives, especially the cutting-\nedge ones that have become household names over the past year, in many cases, over the past six months, can \nyou talk about why you might feel HubSpot is uniquely positioned for those companies",
  " the market clearly is worried that \nvibe coding is going to replace incumbent platforms. But one of the leaders in vibe coding is using you and tells us \nthe power of that. \n \nSo, my question is really this, as you think about your own adoption amongst AI natives, especially the cutting-\nedge ones that have become household names over the past year, in many cases, over the past six months, can \nyou talk about why you might feel HubSpot is uniquely positioned for those companies and why they're choosing \nto use you instead of leveraging all the vibe coding tools and Claude Code and Codex, et cetera, to try to build \ntheir own? Thank you. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nYamini Rangan \nChief Executive Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nI mean, coding has gotten easier, but domain expertise and platform value has not just gone away, right? So, \npeople just equate coding to your ability to build everything. Look, I just said that, internally, in terms of how we \nbuild products, it's completely transformed, and we're building products completely. And of course, everybody \nwithin the company knows vibe coding. Our product managers do it. Our UX managers do it. Our marketeers do \nvibe coding. But it doesn't mean that we are turning around and replacing our core platform, a core HR platform, \nERP platform. We're not building any of that. And so, I think there's a lot that is getting lost in terms of ability to \ncode versus value of a platform. \n \nAnd that's what I would come back to, which is what we deliver is a platform. And it used to be that that platform \nhad unified data. That's why customers came to us. We built something organically. People came to us because \nthere was value in unifying marketing, sales, and service. But what has fundamentally changed now is that it's not \njust about the data. It's the context, because context is what you need to make decisions, whether you're an agent \nor you're a team member that is making decisions on behalf of that agent. And that is what we deliver. And that is \nwhy all AI-native companies, including the ones that you mentioned, are starting with HubSpot as their platform of \nchoice in terms of go-to-market. Dharmesh, go ahead. \n ................................................................................................................................",

A \nYeah. One thing I'd like to add is someone that spends hours a day using agentic coding tools, both AI-native \ncompanies and non-AI companies, the best companies spend the most amount of calories in adding value to their \ncustomers. They don't spend their engineering calories going off and vibe coding a CRM or an ERP or an HR \nsystem, whatever. That just doesn't make sense. So just because it's possible, so we have, as Yamini mentioned, \na large engineering team, knows what they're doing, spending 97% of their kind of calories using agentic coding \ntools, they're not doing it to replace internal platforms. So, we think the best companies, both AI and non-AI, will \nnot be using vibe coding to replace core systems. They'll be doing it to add value to their customers. That's what \nLovable is doing. I think that's what some of the best companies in the world will continue to do. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n \nOperator: Thank you.

This is Eamon Coughlin on for Raimo. Thanks for taking the question. Great to hear that YouTube and \nnewsletter leads are driving to differentiation with LLM-generated answers. Given the challenges that the SEO \nchannel faced throughout 2025, should we think about that as a tailwind to top line throughout 2026? \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nYamini Rangan \nChief Executive Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nI'll maybe talk about the TOFU trends, the top-of-the-funnel trends. And look, yes, there's been overall decline in \nterms of content-generated traffic, traffic that comes through the website. But that's something that we have seen \ncoming. We have diversified the channels. We've talked about our playbook. And that playbook is working, right? \nAnd specifically, you mentioned a couple of like channels. For us, YouTube has grown, newsletters, leads from \nnewsletters have increased more than 50%, and AEO is increasing. \n \nAnd I think like part of the way you should think about it is that the diversification strategy as well as our ability to \nlead with AI is going to help us continue to drive top-of-the-funnel, which is why you're seeing us double down on \nour guidance of net customer additions of 9,000 to 10,000 every quarter going forward. Last year, we added \n40,000 customers. And this year, we'll continue to do it at that pace. And a lot of what we have done in terms of \nthe playbook is what helps us drive customer additions even in a very challenging environment, and then \nmarketing is completely changing. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n \nOperator: Thank you.

Thanks for taking my question. Yamini, I just want to ask about the early adopters of AI agents, whoever \nusing it. What kind of trends are you seeing in terms of them talking about their user expansion or seat \nexpansion? Where is actually that's getting funded, all the AI investment they are doing right now? Also, are you \nseeing any trend differently from your small segment versus scaling mid-market companies? \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nYamini Rangan \nChief Executive Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nOkay. Great question, Siti. So, I'll start with like what are we seeing and then is there any difference between \nsegments. In terms of the AI use cases, use cases that are getting resonance are the ones that show clear \nmeasurable value and clear outcomes. So, it's really about delivering value and showing clear outcomes that is \ndriving the usage. \n \nI would say the strongest traction is Customer Agent and, I would also say, Prospecting Agent. We talked about \nboth of these agents. Data Agent that we launched at Inbound is another one. So, all three agents are seeing \nreally good traction and adoption. And in terms of what customers look for, is it easy to implement and get \nstarted? And is it clear enough to see value? And can they get confidence that the credit consumption is \nsomewhat predictable? And I think it checks the box in each of those areas. \n \nThe one thing I will talk about is Core Seat, right, because when we think about AI monetization, it is both Core \nSeat as well as credits. And we've talked a lot about the credits. On the Core Seat side, as you remember, Siti, \nHubSpot, Inc. (HUBS) \nQ4 2025 Earnings Call \nCorrected Transcript \n11-Feb-2026 \n \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com \n 17 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC \n \nlast year, we included B",

And now, 50% of Core Seat users have tried and are \nusing Breeze Assistant. So, we know that AI is adding value there. Similarly, we added all of the company \nenrichment data into Core Seat. Again, the level of adoption for that Core Seat has really increased in the last \ncouple of quarters. So, our strategy to add a lot of AI and data value into the Core Seat is working. And the \ncombination of Core Seat plus credits is what we think of as durable emerging levers in terms of AI tailwinds. \n \nAnd in terms of what you mentioned in terms of upmarket and downmarket, look, broadly speaking, very similar \ntrends. I think upmarket customers care a little bit more about data security. In fact, a lot of them talked to me \nabout which prompts are encrypted, which prompts are retained, and so on. So, there's a little bit more sensitivity \ntowards data security and prompt usage versus the downmarket segment. But the use cases are about the same. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n \nOperator: Thank you.

Q \nHi. Thanks for taking the question. Yamini, I wanted to follow up on the unified data model. I'm curious where you \nthink that near-term cross-sell opportunity is most significant. Historically, I think we've heard a lot about building \non Marketing Hub with Sales Hub. But as you've kind of broadened out the portfolio, where do you see the \nincremental product adoption really ramping up in 2026?

A \nMaybe clarify the question a little bit. When you said unified data model, are you just talking about multi hub \nadoption or are you talking about something else? \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nBrian Peterson \nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.  Q \nYeah, multi-hub adoption, more from a cross-sell perspective. So as you're looking to kind of go back into your \nbase, where do you see the biggest opportunity for cross-sell in 2026? \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nYamini Rangan \nChief Executive Officer & Director, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nYeah. Yeah. That's a great question. Look, I think in terms of where our customers land, they mostly land with \nMarketing plus Sales Hub. That is a common land pattern, or they land with all five hubs, right? Those are the two \ncommon patterns. If they land with Marketing Hub and Sales Hub, then what happens is that, in a few months, \nthey begin to see the need for Data Hub, because in almost everything that you do with Loop or in almost \neverything that you're doing with sales automation, you need better quality data, ability to ingest more data, ability \nto real-time bring data through AI prompts. And that's what Data Hub provides. And so, the next combination we \nsee is Data Hub. \n \nService Hub is another one where there's a ton of like cross-sell opportunity, especially with the advancements \nthat we have made with Customer Agent, but also across the full platform, embedding, summarization of tickets, \nsentiment analysis, as well as being able to respond quickly. We're beginning to see Service Hub adoption. So, \nthe patterns are land with Marketing Hub and Sales Hub, expand to Service Hub, Data Hub, and Content Hub. \nAnd we are continuing to invest across the platform. And that is the motion that we",

LLC  Q \nPerfect. Thank you so much. I just wanted to touch on maybe the other side of the net retention rate dynamics. \nI'm curious where sort of upsell and upgrades, basically the non-seat-based expansion levers, how those are \nplaying out and whether we've seen sort of an uptick there at all. And maybe as a part of that, we'd just love to \nhear, Yamini, from you on how the kind of SMB \u2013 broader SMB macro environment is evolving, given we've heard \na little bit of noise there. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \nKathryn Bueker \nChief Financial Officer, HubSpot, Inc.  A \nYeah. Thanks, Arjun. We've been talking about the dynamics with net revenue retention for a number of quarters \nnow. So, I think that you're familiar. But we always start the conversation on NRR with customer dollar retention. \nAnd customer dollar retention has remained really strong and consistent for us in the high-80s. It's like ticked up a \nlittle bit this year and we expect the same in next year. Where we've seen really strong upgrade motions is in the \nseats upgrade motion, adding Service Hub seat, adding Sales Hub seat, adding Core Seats. And we're starting to \nsee a building trend",

That's the conversation we've been having over time. And \npeople are adding contacts. They're just not doing it at a rate and pace that is increasing. And our expectation is \nthat those trends are going to continue here for some time. That said, as I shared, we do expect net revenue \nretention to be up 1 to 2 points next year. And that's going to be driven by the continued success in seat upgrade \nrates as well as a building momentum around Core Seats and credits. \n .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n \nOperator: Thank you.
